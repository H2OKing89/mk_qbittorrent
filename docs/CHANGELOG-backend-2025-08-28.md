# Change Log â€” Backend API Implementation Progress (August 28, 2025)

## Recent Backend Work Completed

### 1. FastAPI Backend: Core API Endpoints
- Implemented production-ready FastAPI backend with full settings management, qBittorrent integration, and Docker path mapping.
- All core modules (settings, credentials, torrent management) are type-safe and actively used.

### 2. New API Endpoints for Web UI Parity
- **/api/scan**: Scans a file or folder path, returns total bytes, file count, and mode (file/folder).
- **/api/pieces**: Calculates optimal piece size and piece count for given total bytes and target piece count or manual size.
- **/api/create-enhanced**: Accepts full torrent creation form, starts background job, returns jobId and status URL.
- **/api/create/stream**: Streams real-time progress (SSE) for torrent creation jobs (scan, hash, finalize, done, error events).

### 3. Type Safety and Refactoring
- Replaced all direct manager calls with type-safe helper functions (e.g., `get_settings_storage()`, `get_torrent_manager()`).
- Fixed all type checker errors in FastAPI endpoints.

### 4. End-to-End API Verification
- Verified `/api/scan` with real project directory: returns correct file count and size.
- Verified `/api/pieces` with realistic values: returns correct piece size and count.
- Verified `/api/create-enhanced` with full request model: returns jobId and status URL.
- Verified `/api/create/stream` endpoint: streams job progress as expected.

## Next Steps
- Begin frontend development using this API contract.
- Ensure all edge cases and validation rules from the spec are enforced in backend and surfaced to frontend.
- Continue end-to-end testing as frontend is built.

*This section documents the current backend state as of August 28, 2025. All endpoints required for the web UI are implemented and verified. Ready to proceed with frontend development and further integration testing.*
